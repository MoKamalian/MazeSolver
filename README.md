# Maze Solver

### Description:  
This is a maze solver written in C++ for one of my Data Structures assignments.  
This program will accept a text file containing a maze, solve the maze using  
stack data structures, and output the result to a desired location. The maze  
text files should follow the example in the [test](tests/) directory.  

### Notes:  
The program assumes the maze begins within the top left corner and ends in the  
bottom right corner of the maze. You can also check the [docs](dosc/) folder for  
more information on the assignment.
